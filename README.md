## What Does David Do?

David answers ONE question: **"Where is Nifty going?"**

| Feature | What You Get |
|:---|:---|
| **Direction Prediction** | UP / DOWN / SIDEWAYS with probability % |
| **7-Day Range** | "Nifty will be between 24,800–25,400 (80% confidence)" |
| **30-Day Range** | Monthly expected price band |
| **Support & Resistance** | Real S/R from historical fractals, not synthetic |
| **Whipsaw Detection** | Is the market choppy? Will it flip? |
| **Iron Condor Analyzer** | "Will Nifty touch my strike at 25600?" |
| **Bounce Probability** | "If it drops to 23000, will it come back?" |
| **Trade Recommendation** | Bull Spread / Bear Spread / Iron Condor with exact strikes |

## Model Deep Dive

### 1. Ensemble Direction Classifier

**File:** `models/ensemble_classifier.py`

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[45 Features] --> B[StandardScaler]
    B --> C[XGBoost]
    B --> D[LightGBM]
    B --> E[CatBoost]
    C -->|Prob UP/DOWN/SIDE| F[Weighted Average]
    D -->|Prob UP/DOWN/SIDE| F
    E -->|Prob UP/DOWN/SIDE| F
    F --> G["FINAL: UP 62% / DOWN 25% / SIDE 13%"]
```

**How it works:**
1. Three gradient-boosted classifiers are trained independently
2. Walk-forward cross-validation (5 splits) estimates real accuracy
3. Model weights are assigned proportional to their CV performance
4. Final prediction = weighted average of all three probability vectors
5. Direction = class with highest probability

**Why 3 models?**
- **XGBoost**: Best at non-linear feature interactions (e.g., "RSI > 70 AND VIX falling")
- **LightGBM**: Fastest, best generalization, handles missing data natively
- **CatBoost**: Most robust to overfitting via ordered boosting

**Target classes:**
- `UP`: Next 5 days return > +0.3%
- `DOWN`: Next 5 days return < -0.3%
- `SIDEWAYS`: In between

---

### 2. Regime Detector (5-State HMM)

**File:** `models/regime_detector.py`

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> StrongBull
    [*] --> MildBull
    [*] --> Sideways
    [*] --> MildBear
    [*] --> StrongBear

    StrongBull --> MildBull: Momentum fading
    StrongBull --> Sideways: Profit taking
    MildBull --> StrongBull: Breakout
    MildBull --> Sideways: Consolidation
    MildBull --> MildBear: Reversal

    Sideways --> MildBull: Breakout up
    Sideways --> MildBear: Breakdown
    
    MildBear --> Sideways: Stabilization
    MildBear --> StrongBear: Panic
    StrongBear --> MildBear: Bounce
    StrongBear --> Sideways: V-Recovery
```

**How it works:**
1. Gaussian HMM with 5 hidden states is fitted to 9 features
2. States are auto-labeled by sorting their average return (most negative → Strong Bear)
3. Transition matrix tells you: "Given current regime, what's the probability of switching?"
4. **Micro-direction**: Even in "SIDEWAYS", the ensemble classifier provides a lean (55% UP / 45% DOWN)

**Features used for regime detection:**
`returns_1d`, `returns_5d`, `realized_vol_20`, `rsi_14`, `macd_hist`, `bb_position`, `dist_sma_20`, `dist_sma_50`, `adx`

---

### 3. Range Predictor (Quantile Regression)

**File:** `models/range_predictor.py`

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Current Features] --> B["LightGBM Quantile<br/>α = 0.10"]
    A --> C["LightGBM Quantile<br/>α = 0.25"]
    A --> D["LightGBM Quantile<br/>α = 0.50"]
    A --> E["LightGBM Quantile<br/>α = 0.75"]
    A --> F["LightGBM Quantile<br/>α = 0.90"]

    B --> G["10th pctile: 23,800"]
    C --> H["25th pctile: 24,100"]
    D --> I["Median: 24,400"]
    E --> J["75th pctile: 24,700"]
    F --> K["90th pctile: 25,000"]

    G --> L["80% Band: 23,800 — 25,000"]
    K --> L
    H --> M["50% Band: 24,100 — 24,700"]
    J --> M
```

**How it works:**
- Instead of predicting a single price, we train 5 separate models
- Each model predicts a different percentile of the return distribution
- This gives confidence bands instead of point estimates
- Available for both 7-day and 30-day horizons

---

### 4. Support & Resistance Engine

**File:** `models/sr_engine.py`

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Price History] --> B["Williams Fractal<br/>(5-bar pattern)"]
    B --> C[Swing Highs]
    B --> D[Swing Lows]
    C --> E["DBSCAN Clustering<br/>(0.5% radius)"]
    D --> E
    E --> F["Strength Score<br/>= touches × recency"]
    F --> G["Top 3 Support<br/>Top 3 Resistance"]
```

**How it works:**
1. **Williams Fractal**: A swing high is a bar where the high is higher than `N` bars on each side
2. **DBSCAN Clustering**: Nearby pivots (within 0.5% of each other) are grouped
3. **Strength scoring**: More touches + more recent = stronger level
4. **Output**: Top 3 support levels (below spot) and top 3 resistance levels (above spot)

---

### 5. Whipsaw Detector

**File:** `analyzers/whipsaw_detector.py`

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[BB Squeeze] -->|Width < 20th pctile| F["Whipsaw Score"]
    B[ADX < 20] -->|No trend| F
    C[ATR Expansion] -->|Vol expanding| F
    D[Candle Flip Rate] -->|> 60% flips| F
    E["VIX > Realized Vol"] -->|Mean reversion| F
    
    F --> G{Score > 55%?}
    G -->|Yes| H["⚠️ CHOPPY<br/>Use wider stops"]
    G -->|No| I["✅ TRENDING<br/>Follow signals"]
```

**5 independent signals are combined:**

| Signal | Weight | Trigger |
|:---|:---|:---|
| BB Squeeze | 0.75 | BB width in bottom 20th percentile |
| ADX Trend | 0.80 | ADX below 20 (no trend) |
| ATR Expansion | 0.60 | ATR ratio > 1.3x average |
| Candle Flips | 0.70 | > 60% of candles flip direction |
| VIX-RV Divergence | 0.40 | VIX > 1.3x realized vol |

### 6. Iron Condor Analyzer

**File:** `analyzers/iron_condor_analyzer.py`

**Input:** "I have an iron condor at 25600"

**Output:**
- **Touch Probability**: 23% chance Nifty reaches 25600 in 5 days
- **Recovery Probability**: If touched, 68% chance it bounces back
- **Firefight Level**: Start hedging at 25,200 (70% of the way to strike)
- **Whipsaw Level**: Expect bounce at 25,050 after firefight

**Method:** Pure empirical — counts how many times in 10 years of history the market made a similar percentage move.

---

### 7. Bounce-Back Analyzer

**File:** `analyzers/bounce_analyzer.py`

Answers: "If Nifty drops to 23000, what's the chance it recovers to current levels?"

Checks recovery across 3 timeframes (5/10/20 days) using the full historical distribution, adjusted for current volatility regime.

## Honesty Note

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **100% win rate is not achievable in financial markets.** No ML model, no matter how sophisticated, can predict random walks perfectly. What David provides is:
> - The **highest achievable directional accuracy** from historical patterns
> - **Honest probability estimates** so you know WHEN to skip uncertain trades
> - **Risk management tools** (whipsaw detection, firefight levels) to protect your capital
>
> The system reports its actual walk-forward accuracy. If it says 55%, that means it's right 55% of the time — which, combined with proper position sizing and spread strategies, can be profitable.
