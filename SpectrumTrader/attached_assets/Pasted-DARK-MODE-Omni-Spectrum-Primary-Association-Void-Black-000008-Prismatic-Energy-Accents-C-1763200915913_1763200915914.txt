DARK MODE — “Omni Spectrum”
Primary Association:

Void Black (#000008) + Prismatic Energy Accents (Cyan → Magenta → Violet)

Why this is the only correct logic:

“Omni Spectrum” means all wavelengths, but you cannot dump a rainbow in a dark UI — that looks childish.
The professional interpretation is a spectral gradient along the high-energy end.

In physics/optics, spectra on black appear as cyan, magenta, violet, electric blue — the high-frequency region.

Dark backgrounds amplify spectral colors; this matches scientific imaging, spectroscopy, quantum visuals.

Warm wavelengths (red, orange, yellow) create noise and kill the technical identity unless used extremely subtly.

Dark Mode Palette: (Accurate + Professional)

Background: #000008 (ultra-deep spectrum black)

Primary Spectrum Highlight:

Cyan (#00E5FF)

Electric Blue (#2A6BFF)

Magenta (#D400FF)

Violet (#7A00FF)

Secondary: #1A1E2A (cosmic charcoal)

Glow Color: #06F7DD (spectral neon)

Tone: scientific, quantum, prismatic, high-energy.

LIGHT MODE — “Omni Spectrum”
Primary Association:

Clean White (#FFFFFF / #FAFAFF) + Structured, controlled spectral micro-gradients

Why:

Light-mode cannot use dark-space spectral visuals; they wash out.

The logical identity becomes subtle, linear, fine-spectrum accents.

Think spectroscopy charts, wavelength lines, thin frequency strips.

Light Mode Palette:

Background: #FAFAFF (near-white with faint blue bias)

Primary Spectrum:

Linear Blue → Purple gradient (#005CFF → #A000FF)

Secondary: #2C2C2C (graphite for high contrast)

Soft Spectrum Hints: Faint magenta/cyan micro-bands at 2–4% opacity

Borders/Grid: #D5D8E0 (cool scientific grey)

Tone: clean, analytical, wavelength-based, minimal.

Blunt Evaluation

If you choose:

rainbow

pastel tones

warm neutrals

flat blue or flat purple
You effectively ruin the meaning of Omni Spectrum.
The name demands energy, physics, and full-range spectral logic, not childish multicolor palettes.

The correct identity is:

Dark Mode: void-black + neon spectral highlights

Light Mode: clean white + controlled spectral gradients

This is mathematically and visually consistent with:

optics

spectroscopy

quantum visualization

scientific instrumentation UIs
